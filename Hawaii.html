Hawaii is known world wide for its beauty and as some call it, paradise. One of the known attractions on the island of Oahu is 
the Duke Kahanamoku Statue located on Kalakaua Ave by Waikiki Beach. Duke was born on August 24, 1890 and was a famous Olympian
/Surfer/Swimmer. He competed in the 1912 and 1920 Olympics bringing home the gold medal to the USA both times. Another attraction
down the street is the Honolulu Zoo and Aquarium. A popular tourist attraction is the Pearl Harbor Tour. In this tour you can
see and go on the actual submarines/ships that were apart of the Attack of Pearl Harbor. This is an all day event that you wouldn't
want to miss. Diamond head is another site you wouldn't want to miss. Tourists take a 4/5 of a mile (1.6 miles round trip) up a
dormant volcano to an amazing view of the crater and the island. Oahu is also home of the Largest Open Air Shopping Center called
Ala Moana. This shopping center has over 150 different stores and covers 1,351,000 square feet. One way of transportation is the
Waikiki Trolley which works just like the Gold Line we have in South Pasadena. This takes people all over to the Diamond Head Hike,
Swap Meet, and local places in the city of Waikiki.

The Big Island also known as Hawaii has many other interesting attractions. One main thing the Big Island is known for is it snows
at the very top of Mauna Kea mountain. Another fun fact is that there is still active lava flow on the island. There are two sides
to the island, the Hilo side which is usually rainy and humid but a beautiful sight when it clears. The other side is the Kona
side. On both sides there are beautiful beaches, even black sand beaches. There are market places such as Kings and Queens village
on the Kona side. Also there is a cultural festival that occurs every year around August. Here people come together to help express 
Hawaii's culture and get others interested all for free. Activities can be from gourd making to basket weaving with palm frons. 
The Hilo side of Hawaii is more known for its scenery since it rains constantly. There is so much green land because of the rain.
There's also beautiful beaches on the Hilo side as well.

Maui is a beautiful island filled with white, black, and red sand beaches. The island is home to the Haleakala Volcano and bike 
path. The crater to this volcano is 21 miles across and 4,000 feet deep. This is the worlds largest dormant volcano. Another famous
attraction in Maui is the Road to Hana. This is a winding path all the way up Haleakala, a 45 mile trip to see beautiful sights.
Every year Maui has a swap meet. This is a place where people come together to sell their products to tourists. Products can range
from hand carved wood work to cell phone cases. It's a good way to experience a little bit of their culture and shop as well. A 
popular town on Maui is Lahaina, this is a historic town transformed into a shopping alley. Here there are restaurants, shops,
art galleries, and even night clubs. A fun attraction to see if you are going to Hawaii between December and May is whale watching.
Maui is known as one of the worlds best places to whale watch.
