One city I would want to see in China is Beijing is Guangzhou because that's where I was born. Another city I would want to
visit Beijing. In Beijing I would definitely would want to see the Great Wall of China. This is a famous landmark built in 
c. 206 BC. In all its 13,170.7 miles. The Great Wall was built in order to protect Silk Road trade and prevent invasion. 
It has watchtowers for defense for the military to keep a look out for invasions. Sadly today 30 percent of the original wall
is gone. Another place I'd want to visit is the Forbidden City. This city was built in 1420 originally home to 24 emperors during
the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Chinese astronomers believed that the Purple Star (Polaris) was the center of heaven and their
emperor lived in the purple palace. All outsiders were forbidden to enter unless special permission hence the name The Purple
Forbidden City. I would also like to see the Temple of Heaven. Every year at the winter solsist, emperors would come and pray 
in the temple for good harvest.

One place in Shanghai I would definitely want to go is Shanghai Disneyland. I've been to Disneyland in California and I would
want to see the differences between the two. In fact this was opened this year on June 16, 2016. Another place I'd want to go 
is the Oriental Pearl Tower. It's the third tallest tower in the world and is 468 meters high. This was made for essentially
communication but now also serves as a viewing place of the city. The TV tower has three viewing platforms at 90 meter, 263
meters, and 350 meters. I would also want to see the Yu Gardens in Shanghai as well. These gardens were built in 1559 during
the Ming Dynasty. It occupies 5 acres and was built by Pan Yunduan to comfort his father who was elderly at the time.

<h2><font size="6">Other Places</font></h2>
<p><font size="4.5">
Some other places I want to go to is the Red Sand Beach in Panjin China (left). This in fact doesn't even have real sand but has 
sea weed called Sueda. It starts growing in April and May and is at first green. However when fall comes around it turns a 
vibrant red. This is the biggest land marsh in the world. Another place I'd want to go is the Rainbow Mountains at Zhangye 
Danxia National Park (right). These mountains were formed by the erosion of red sand stone. The best time to take pictures and visit
is in the Morning or Afternoon when the colors change continuously.
