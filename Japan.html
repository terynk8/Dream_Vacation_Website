One of the things I'd want to see when I go to Japan would be Mount Fuji. This is an active volcano in Japan that is
located on Honshu Island. Its 12,388 feet high and a beautiful sight to see. I've wanted to go to Japan because of all
the cute things they sell and all of the sites to see. Another place I'd want to see is the Tokyo Tower. This is the 
second tallest building in Japan. It opened in 1958 and stands 1,092 feet tall. Also, I'm interested in seeing the Cherry
Blossoms which can bloom in January all the way to March depending on which part of Japan you are visiting. I'm interested
in the culture and different authentic foods they have. I've always wanted to try authentic Japanese cuisine and compare it 
to the Japanese food in America. Another thing I'd want to see in the city of Tokyo is all the people dressed up as
Harajuku girls on the streets. The Tokyo Imperial Palace is a place I would also want to see. The total area of it is 3.41
square kilometers including the beautiful gardens.

Kyoto was once the capital of Japan, however currently it is Tokyo. Kyoto is a city on the island of Honshu. I want to go to
Kyoto to see all of the Temples and Shrines. It is known for its Buddhist temples and pretty gardens. One temple I would want
to see is the Kinkaku-Ji temple, or known as the gold colored temple. This temple was built in 1393 for a guy named Shogun
Yoshimitsu Ashikaga. However the original was burned down many times in the Onin War. Another temple I would want to see is
the Nijo Castle. This is a wooden castle with beautiful gardens built in 1601.
