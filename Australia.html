I want to visit the Sydney Opera House because it is a famous landmark in Australia. In 6th grade I had learned a little bit about 
it and thought it would be neat to see it in real life. Here I can watch a play which also would be very interested in.

<p><font size="4.5">
I am interested in seeing The Rocks. This is a historical and shopping center combined and is famous in the city of Sydney. Here
I would want to learn about the History of Australia and experience the culture.

<p><font size="4.5">
Another site I would want to see is the Sydney Harbour Bridge because it also is another famous site that's a must see when you're
in Sydney. This is a steel bridge that carries traffic between Sydney and the North Shore.

<p><font size="4.5">
The Great Barrier Reef is beautiful place in Australia that I would want to visit because I learned about it through a biome project
and thought it would be neat to see in real life. The reef is the largest coral reef in the world and is made up of over 2,900
individual reefs. There is about 2,100 different kinds of species currently living in the Great Barrier Reef and scientists
are stil discovering more.

<p><font size="4.5">
I want to visit the Great Ocean Road because it looks like a really pretty site to see and you might get a chance to see some
koalas and kangaroos on the way. The entire length of the road is 151 miles. Also along the path you can see other great sites
such as the collapse of the London Bridge and the 12 Apostles.
